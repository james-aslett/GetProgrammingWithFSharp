//In F#, the overall emphasis is to enable you to solve complex problems with simple code. You want to focus on solving the problem at hand without necessarily having to first think about design patterns within which you can put your code, or complex syntax. All the features you're going to see now are geared toward helping to achieve that. F# does have some common 'design-patternish' features, but in my experience, they're few and far between, with less emphasis on them.
